I am currently a PhD student in Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics at China University of GeoSciences (Wuhan).

My research has been focusing on how to bring together different sources of measured geomechanical and elastic properties to predict and characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs which involves **Exploration Seismology**, **Well Log Analysis**, **Reservoir Geomechanics**, and **Geopressure Analysis**.

Another research direction of mine is in **Geostatistical Simulation**, and **Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis**. In particular, I have been using Geostatistics to study the uncertainty of reservoir property predictions and methodologies to present it quantitatively. I have also used Geostatistical tools to describe porous media in a stochastic manner, which is the topic of my Bachelor degree dissertation.

I have also been involved in several software-building projects that develops professional tools for seismic data processing (for pi-frame) and reservoir modeling (for Jewel Suite).

Computer programing as both an essential skill for scientific research and as a pastime has always fascinated me since the first time that I learned C programming during my sophomore year in college. For scientific computation, I have experiences with coding in several programing languages, such C/C++, C#, Fortran, Matlab and Python. As can be seen in my github repos, Python is currently my main programing language hence the title pythonista (lol). I have been using it for all kinds of errands, writing scientific algorithms (numpy and numba helps accelerating them), preparing beautiful graphs for publication (matpltolib), developing traditional desktop software (pyqt), and building websites (as this site). Python keeps inspiring me learn more about computer technology and software carpentry.
